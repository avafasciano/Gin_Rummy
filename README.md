# Gin-Rummy

A program that plays Gin Rummy. We follow the game rules outlined by Bicycle cards. Our project includes a game engine, serving as an arena to generate the training data for the computer game-player. It will facilitate the rounds of the game between two players, being either human and human, human and computer, or computer and computer, playing rounds until a player reaches 100 points.

Further work: This game is not interesting yet. I plan to develop a zero-knowledge computer player using ML that plays against itself to find the best strategy for winning Gin Rummy.
