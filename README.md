# Gin-Rummy

An AI program that plays Gin Rummy. We will follow the game rules outlined by Bicycle cards. Our project includes game engine, serving as an arena to generate the training data for the computer game-player. It will facilitate the rounds of the game between two players, being either human and human, human and computer, or computer and computer, playing rounds until a player reaches 100 points.
